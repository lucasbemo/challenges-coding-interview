# Binary Search Algorithm

It is used to search and find an element in a sorted array.

The binary search algorithm is a divide and conquer algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted array.

Note that the collection of elements/array must be sorted for the algorithm to work efficiently.


***Differences Between Binary Search Algorithm and Binary Search Tree***

Although both binary search algorithm and binary search tree are both used for searching, there are some differences in mode operation of operation and data structure.

***Here are some differences:***
- Binary search algorithm is used for searching while binary search tree is used for searching, insertion, and deletion.
- Binary search algorithm compares the middle element with the element being searched for while binary search tree compares the value of nodes in a tree.
- Binary search algorithm searches through an array or list while binary search tree traverses through a tree of nodes.
