# What Makes an Algorithm Greedy?

In a greedy algorithm, decisions are made step-by-step with the goal of finding a solution by choosing the optimal 
choice at each step without revisiting previous steps. A greedy approach makes local decisions to aim for a global 
solution, often in a single pass through the data. 

Greedy algorithms are commonly used when:
- We want to find an optimal solution with minimal processing.
- Each step can be completed based on local (current) information without needing to look ahead or consider 
combinations or permutations.
