Check whether two Strings are anagram of each other

Given two strings s1 and s2 consisting of lowercase characters, the task is to check whether the two given strings are anagrams of each other or not. An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, “act” and “tac” are anagrams of each other.

Examples:

```
Input: str1 = “listen”  str2 = “silent”
Output: “Anagram”
Explanation: All characters of “listen” and “silent” are the same.

Input: str1 = “gram”  str2 = “arm”
Output: “Not Anagram”
```
